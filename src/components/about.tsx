          <p>
            Hi! I&apos;m an experienced Full-Stack Developer and DevOps Engineer
            with over 2 years of experience building modern web applications and
            scalable infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in creating efficient, maintainable code and designing
            robust deployment pipelines. My approach combines technical
            expertise with a deep understanding of business needs to deliver
            solutions that make a real impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me exploring new
            technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or hiking in the
            mountains.
          </p>
